    I am an aspiring video game developer/engineer. I want to dabble in all things STEM/STEAM (including arts!)
    It would be cool to make all aspects of a video game from scratch! From character design, ui, story telling, to voice acting...
    so much to learn ðŸ˜° I want to be a well-rounded person
